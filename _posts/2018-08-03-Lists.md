## The Mystery of the Walrus

Does the change to **b** affect **a**?

```java
Walrus a = new Walrus(1000, 8.3);
Walrus b;
b = a;
b.weight = 5;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);
```

Does the change to **x** affect **y**?

```java
int x = 5;
int y;
y = x;
x = 2;
System.out.println("x is: " + x);
System.out.println("y is: " + y);
```

Answer:

```
a -> weight: 5, tusk size: 8.30
b -> weight: 5, tusk size: 8.30
x -> 2
y -> 5
```

### Bits

All information in computer is stored in **memory** as a sequence of **ones** and **zeros**. Some examples:

* 72 is often stored as 01001000
* 205.75 is often stored as 01000011 01001101 11000000 00000000
* The letter H is often stored as 01001000
* The true value is often stored as 00000001

Notice that both `72` and `H` are stored as `01001000`. How does a piece of Java code know how to interpret `01001000`. The answer is through `types`.

In Java, there are 8 primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, and char.

### Declaring a Variable(Simplified)

For example, if you declared `int x` and `double y`, then Java might decide to use bits **352** through **384** of your computer's memory to store **x**, and bits **20800** through **20864** to store **y**. In addition to setting aside memory, the Java interpreter also creates an entry in an internal table that maps each variable name to the location of the first bit in the box. So the interpreter will then record that **int x** starts at bit **352** and **y** starts at bit **20800**.

### The Golden Rule of Equals (GRoE)

When you write `y = x`, Java interpreter copy the bits from **x** to **y**.

### Reference Types

There are 8 primitive types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char.

Everything else, including arrays, is not a primitive type but rather a `reference type`.

#### Object Instantiation

We create a Walrus using `new Walrus(1000, 8.3);`, then we end up with a Walrus consisting of two boxes of 32 and 64 bits respectively. 

(In real implementations of the Java programming language, there is actually some additional overhead for any object, so a Walrus takes somewhat more than 96 bits.)

#### Reference Variable Declaration

When we **declare** a variable of any reference type(Walrus, Dog, array, etc.), Java allocates a box of 64 bits, n**o matter what type of object**.

Then, when assign to a variable, its address is returned by the `new` operator.

For example:

```java
Walrus someWalrus;
someWalrus = new Walrus(1000, 8.3);
```

The first line creates a box of 64 bits.

The second line creates a new Walrus, and the address is returned by the `new` operator. These bits are then copied into the `someWalrus` box according to the GRoE.
