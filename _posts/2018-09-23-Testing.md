Create a class called `Sort` that provides a method `sort(String[] x)` that destructively sorts the strings in the array `x`.

Start by writing `testSort()` first, and only after we've finished the test, we'll move on to writing the actual sorting code.

# testSort

Writing a test for `Sort.sort`, we'll simply create an input, and call `sort`, then check if the output of the method is correct.

```java
public class TestSort {
    /** Tests the sort method of the Sort class. */
    public static void testSort() {
        String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
        String[] expected = {"an", "egg", "have", "i"};
        Sort.sort(input);
        for (int i = 0; i < input.length; i += 1) {
            if (!input[i].equals(expected[i])) {
                System.out.println("Mismatch in position " + i + ", expected: " + expected + ", but got: " + input[i] + ".");
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testSort();
    }
}
```

**Important Note:** 

Why don't just check if the arrays are equal using "=="?

Reason: When we test for equality of two **objects**, we cannot use `==`, because `==` compares the literal bits in the memory boxes, **not** whether the values in the arrays are the same.

So, we use the loop in `testSort`, and we can use the build-in method `java.util.Arrays.equals` instead of a loop.

### JUint test

The `org.junit` provides a number of helpful methods that can simplify the writing fo tests. For example (I use JUint5)

```java
public static void testSort() {
    String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
    String[] expected = {"an", "egg", "have", "i"};
    Sort.sort(input);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertArrayEquals(expected, input);
}
```

# Selection Sort

The simplest sorting algorithm:
* Find the smallest item.
* Move it to the front.
* Selection sort the remaining N-1 items (without touching the front item).

### findSmallest

Writing a test before we complete the method.

```java
public class TestSort {
    ...
    public static void testFindSmallest() {
        String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
        String expected = "an";

        String actual = Sort.findSmallest(input);
        org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(expected, actual);        
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testFindSmallest();
    }
}
```
Then we complete the `findSmallest` method.
```java
/** Returns the smallest string in x. 
  * @source Got help with string compares from https://goo.gl/a7yBU5. */
public static String findSmallest(String[] x) {
    String smallest = x[0];
    for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i += 1) {
        int cmp = x[i].compareTo(smallest);
        if (cmp < 0) {
            smallest = x[i];
        }
    }
    return smallest;
}
```

### Swap

Writing the test method first.
```java
public class TestSort {
    ...    

    /** Test the Sort.swap method. */
    public static void testSwap() {
        String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
        int a = 0;
        int b = 2;
        String[] expected = {"an", "have", "i", "egg"};

        Sort.swap(input, a, b);
        org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertArrayEquals(expected, input);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        testSwap();
    }
}
```
Then write the `swap` method, pay attention on the `temp`.
```java
public static void swap(String[] x, int a, int b) {
    String temp = x[a];
    x[a] = x[b];
    x[b] = temp;
}
```
We can simply use `x[a], x[b] = x[b], x[a]` in Python.

### Revising findSmallest

Now we can trying to connect the pieces. But we found a mismatch:

`findSmallest` returns a `String`, and `swap` expects two indices.

So we can adjust `findSmallest` as follows:

```java
public static int findSmallest(String[] x) {
    int smallestIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i += 1) {
        int cmp = x[i].compareTo(x[smallestIndex]);
        if (cmp < 0) {
            smallestIndex = i;
        }
    }
    return smallestIndex;
}
```
Also, we need to update the `testFindSmallest` method.

```java
/** Test the Sort.findSmallestIndex method. */
@Test
public void testFindSmallestIndex() {
    String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg"};
    int expected = 2;

    int actual = Sort.findSmallestIndex(input);
    org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(expected, actual);
}
```

### Recursive Helper Methods

We should make the recursive call to complete `sort`:

```java
/** Sorts strings destructively. */
public static void sort(String[] x) { 
   int smallestIndex = findSmallest(x);
   swap(x, 0, smallestIndex);
   // recursive call??
}
```

We need to call a sub-array, the problem of needing to consider only a subset of a larger array is very common.

A typical solution is to create a private helper method that has an additional parameter(s) that delineate which part of the array to consider.

For example:
```java
/** Sorts strings destructively starting from item start. */
private static void sort(String[] x, int start) { 
   int smallestIndex = findSmallest(x);
   swap(x, start, smallestIndex);
   sort(x, start + 1);
}
```

### Debugging and completing sort method

The first issue is we forgot to include a base case in `sort` method.

```java
/** Sorts strings destructively starting from item start. */
private static void sort(String[] x, int start) { 
   if (start == x.length) {
       return;
   }
   int smallestIndex = findSmallest(x);
   swap(x, start, smallestIndex);
   sort(x, start + 1);
}
```

We still have another problem that cannot find immediately.

ðŸŒŸ When we use debugger, we can identify a line of code whose result does not match our expectations.

Because we debug the code at a higher level of abstraction, using `Step Over` more than `Step Into`, save us a lot of time by compare the results of entire function calls with expectation.

Finally we find the problem is at `findSmallest` method which return the smallest index of the entire array. We need add an extra parameter `start` that return the smallest index from the given index.

```java
public static int findSmallest(String[] x, int start) {
    int smallestIndex = start;
    for (int i = start; i < x.length; i += 1) {
        int cmp = x[i].compareTo(x[smallestIndex]);
        if (cmp < 0) {
            smallestIndex = i;
        }
    }
    return smallestIndex;
}
```

Then we modify the `testFindSmallestIndex` method.

```java
public void testFindSmallestIndex() {
    String[] input = {"i", "have", "an", "egg", "bb"};
    int expected = 4;

    int actual = Sort.findSmallestIndex(input, 3);
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}
```

Here is the final version of `sort` method.

```java
/** Sorts strings destructively starting from item start. */
private static void sort(String[] x, int start) { 
   if (start == x.length) {
       return;
   }
   int smallestIndex = findSmallest(x, start);
   swap(x, start, smallestIndex);
   sort(x, start + 1);
}
```

# ðŸŒŸ Reflections on the Development Process

When you're writing and debugging a program, you'll often find yourself switching between different contexts. Trying to hold too much in your brain at once is a recipe for disater at worst, and slow progress at best.

Having a set of automated tests helps reduce this cognitive load.

For example:

We were in the middle of writing `sort` when we realized there was a bug in `findSmallest`. We were able to switch contexts to consider `findSmallest` and establish that it was correct using our `testFindSmallest` method, and then switch back to `sort`.

This is in sharp contrast to a more naive approach where you would simply be calling `sort` over and over and trying to figure out if the behavior of the overall algorithm suggests that the `findSmallest` method is correct.

Lastly, tests make it easier to refactor your code. Suppose you decide to rewrite `findSmallest` so that it is faster or more readable, we can safely do so by making our desired changes and seeing if the tests still work.

### Better JUnit

First, we use **test annotation**:

* Precede each method with `@org.junit.jupiter.api.Test`.
* Change each test method to be non-static.
* Remove our `main` method from the `TestSort` class.

There are several advantages:

* No need to manually invoke tests.
* If one test fails, the others still run.
* A count of how many tests were run and how many passed is provided.

Second, in order to shorter the names of some very lengthy method names, we use **import statement**

E.g. We add `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;` to the top of our file. Then we can replace `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertArrayEquals(expected, input);` to simply `assertArrayEquals(expected, input);`.
